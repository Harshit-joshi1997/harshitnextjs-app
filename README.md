## 📦 Getting Started

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to the project directory (if you're not already inside it):
cd next-app

Install project dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev

If the above command doesn’t work, ensure you're inside the next-app folder and try again:
cd next-app
npm run dev

Once the server starts, a local development URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) will be shown in the terminal. Click the link or open it in your browser to view the app.
